      <p class="card-largetext">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>

          ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù
